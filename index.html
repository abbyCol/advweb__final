                    The one ring was forged in Mount Doom by <button onclick="openOverlay('overlay_three')"> Sauron</button> in the Second Age to create a ring that had all-encompassing power. The story puts us in the scene of Smeagol, or Gollum, discovering the ring. This seals the fate for Bilbo and Frodo. The ring causes the wearer to become addicted or seemingly possessed by the desire to possess the ring, which is what changed Smeagol into the creature Gollum.

                    Orcs were created by torturing elves who had wicked intentions. They were created by the first Dark Lord, Morgoth, to dominate the middle earth. Surviving in deep caves and pits they multiply to do the bidding of evil forces. They destroy the world that they live in as violence is their nature. Notable orcs are Azgog and the Pale Orc. These orcs hunt down the protagonists throughout all of the novels.
